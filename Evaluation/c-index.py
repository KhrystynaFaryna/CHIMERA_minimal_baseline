"""
The following is a simple example evaluation method.

It is meant to run within a container.

To run it locally, you can call the following bash script:

  ./test_run.sh

This will start the evaluation, reads from ./test/input and outputs to ./test/output

To save the container and prep it for upload to Grand-Challenge.org you can call:

  ./save.sh

Any container that shows the same behavior will do, this is purely an example of how one COULD do it.

Happy programming!
